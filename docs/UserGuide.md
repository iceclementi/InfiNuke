## **General Usage**   
This section will explain the fundamental structure of the **Nuke** application, and important guidelines to follow to ensure smooth usage of the application.    
  
### **Nuke Structure**  
**Nuke** follows the structure of a **Directory Tree** &#127795; _(i.e. folder sub-folder structure)_. This Directory Tree comprises various levels:  
  
<div style="text-align: center"><span style="color: green"><small>Table <b>Directory Levels</b></small></span></div>  
  
| Directory Level | Description                                                                      |  
|:---------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Root** | The **base** of the Directory Tree. Only **one** root exists in the entire Tree.<br>Added _modules_ are in this level. |  
| **Module** | The **second** level of the Directory Tree.<br>Added _categories_ are in this level.  |  
| **Category** | The **third** level of the Directory Tree.<br>Added _tasks_ are in this level.      |  
| **Task** | The **fourth** level of the Directory Tree.<br>Added _files_ are in this level.         |  
| **File** | The **last** level of the Directory Tree.<br>Nothing else can be added.                 |  
  
<br>  
  
Below is an illustration of a possible <b>Directory Tree</b> structure:      
<br>  
![Directory Tree Image](images/Tree.png)    
<span style="color: green"><small><i>Figure <b>Sample Directory Tree</b></i></small></span>  
  
<br>  
  
#### **Root**    
The **Root** Directory is the **base** of the entire Directory Tree. Only **one** root exists in the entire Tree. _Modules_ are added into this level into a **Module List**. A _module_ consists of both a *module code* and a _module title_.   
  
<div class="alert alert-warning">  
<i class="fa fa-exclamation"></i> <b>Note</b> <br>   
Only <b>NUS modules</b> are allowed to be added in <b>Nuke</b>.    
</div>  
  
#### **Module**   
The **Module** Directory is the **second** level of the Directory Tree.  Each _module_ has a **Category List** that has several _categories_ to categorise your _tasks_, such as Lecture, Tutorial and Assignment, so that you can further organise your _tasks_. A _category_ consists of a _name_ and a _priority_ to indicate the importance of the _tasks_ in that _category_.    
<div class="alert alert-info">  
<i class="fa fa-info"></i> <b>Info</b> <br>   
Upon adding a <i>module</i>, <b>Nuke</b> automatically adds four <i>categories</i> into the <i>module</i>. They are Lecture, Tutorial, Assignment and Lab. So, you don't have to add those <i>categories</i> yourself!  
</div>     
  
#### **Category**  
The **Category** Directory is the **third** level of the Directory Tree. Each _category_ has a **Task List** that can contain any number of _tasks_, which are ideally related to the _category_. A _task_ has several attributes, namely the _description_, _deadline_ of the _task_ if any, _priority_ and the _done status_ of the _task_.  
  
#### **Task**  
The **Task** Directory is the **fourth** level of the Directory Tree. Each _task_ can have _files_ attached to the it. _Files_ are stored in the **File List**. The _file_ must have a _file name_ and the _path_ to the _file_.     
  
#### **File**  
The **File** Directory is the **last** level of the Directory Tree. It contains no other directories.     
  
<div class="alert alert-warning">  
<i class="fa fa-exclamation"></i> <b>Note</b> <br>   
The <b>Nuke</b> application adheres to this Directory Tree structure strictly. It is important to note that you can only add a directory into a directory which is <b><i>exactly</i> one level lower</b>. <br>  
For example, you can only add a <i>task</i> into the <b>Category</b> directory, and not directly into the <b>Module</b> directory.  
</div>  
  
<div class="alert alert-info">  
<i class="fa fa-info"></i> <b>Tip</b> <br>   
You can shorten the commands you enter by first entering into a directory. Then you do <b>not</b> need to enter the full <i>directory path</i> in your command! <br><br>  
To learn how to traverse the various directories, see the <b><a href="#6-change-directory">Change Directory</a></b> command.  
</div>     
  
[Back To Top](#table-of-contents)  
  
<br>  
  
### **Command Format**   
In this <b>User Guide</b>, the format for each feature _(command)_ will usually be of this form:    
`CommandWord <attr0> -pfix1 <attr1> ... [ -pfix2 <attr2> ... ] { -pfix3 <attr3> -pfix4 <attr4> ... }`  
  
#### **Command Word**  
Each command you give to **Nuke** has to begin with its corresponding unique **command word**. This helps **Nuke** to know that you want it to execute a particular command.    
  
#### **Attribute**  
**Attributes** are information to be provided in the command. An **attribute** for the command will be wrapped in angular brackets `< >` to help you to recognise it.     
  
#### **Prefix**  
A **prefix** is used to provide additional supplementary information to the command. More information on the various **command prefixes** can be found [here](#command-prefixes).     
   
#### **Optional**   
Some **attributes** and **prefixes** are _optional_ and the command can still execute properly even when omitted. However, they may be useful if you want to provide a more specific information to the command. Optional **attributes** and **prefixes** will be wrapped in square brackets `[ ]` to help you to recognise them.     
  
#### **Any**    
There are times when you may have to include at least one from a set of **attributes** and **prefixes**. You may choose to include one <i>or</i> more from the set, but <b>not</b> none of them. Such **attributes** and **prefixes** will be wrapped in curly brackets `{ }` to help you to recognise them.     
  
[Back To Top](#table-of-contents)  
  
<br>  
  
### **Command Prefixes**  
On many occasions, you may be required to enter more information to describe the commands you give to **Nuke**. For example, when adding a _task_, you may need to specify the _module_ and _category_ to add the _task_ into. You may also want to include additional attributes such as the _deadline_ and _priority_. All these information can only be recognised by **Nuke** if they are preceded by the correct **prefix**.<br>      
All **command prefixes** in **Nuke** begins with a `-` and followed by a **letter**. Below is the exhaustive list of **command prefixes** and general information that should follow after.     
  
<div style="text-align: center"><span style="color: green"><small>Table <b>Command Prefixes</b></small></span></div>  
  
| Command Prefix | General Definition                                               |  
|:--------------:|------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| `-m`           | The _module code_ of the _**m**odule_ |  
| `-c`           | The _name_ of the _**c**ategory_ |  
| `-t`           | The _description_ of the _**t**ask_ |  
| `-f`           | The _name_ or _path_ of the _**f**ile_ |  
| `-d`           | The _**d**eadline_ of the _task_ |  
| `-p`           | The _**p**riority_ of the _category_ or _task_ |  
| `-e`           | To indicate whether filtering is done **e**xactly                |  
| `-a`           | To indicate whether filtering is done across **a**ll directories |  
  
<br>  
  
<div class="alert alert-warning">  
<i class="fa fa-exclamation"></i> <b>Note</b> <br>   
Because each <b>prefix</b> begins with a <code>-</code>, <b>Nuke</b> has to unfortunately restrict your choice of names for the directories. <br>  
Specifically, each word in the name of your directory has to begin with a alpha-numeric <i>(i.e. non-symbol)</i> or underscore character.  
</div>

## **Features**  
### **1. Add**  
Adds a <i>module</i>, <i>category</i>,  <i>task</i> or <i>file</i> into their respective lists.<br>   
   
As mentioned previously, **Nuke** follows the structure of a [**Directory Tree**](#nuke-structure) _(i.e. folder sub-folder structure)_. **Nuke** complements the Linux shell command by offering a generic add command word for creating a directory: `mkdir` <br>   
Below sums up what `mkdir` does at each level of the Directory.   
  
<div style="text-align: center"><span style="color: green"><small>Table <b>Generic Add</b></small></span></div>  
  
| Current Level   | What Happens?                                                        |  
|:---------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| <b>Root</b>     | `mkdir <module code>` adds a *module* into the current directory     |  
| <b>Module</b>   | `mkdir <category name>` adds a *category* into the current directory |  
| <b>Category</b> | `mkdir <task description>` adds a *task* into the current directory  |  
| <b>Task</b>     | `mkdir <file name>` adds a *file* into the current directory         |  
| <b>File</b>     | You cannot `mkdir` here! &#128532;                                   |  
  
  
The above commands have to be done in their corresponding directories. Conversely, the commands below can be done in any directory, but may require you to enter <i>additional</i> information.     
  
<div class="alert alert-info">  
<i class="fa fa-info"></i> <b>Tip</b> <br>   
In many of the <b>Add</b> commands, you have to enter the <i>directory path</i> of the <i>directory</i> you wish to add the item into. You <b>can</b> shorten the commands you enter by first entering into a directory. Then you do <b>not</b> need to enter the full <i>directory path</i> in your command! &#128522; <br><br>  
To learn how to traverse the various directories, see the <b><a href="#6-change-directory">Change Directory</a></b> command.  <br><br>  
For more information on how and if you can <b>not</b> enter  the <i>full directory path</i>, see <a href="#can-i-not-enter-the-full-path">here</a>.  
</div>     
  
[Back To Top](#table-of-contents)  
<br>  
  
  
#### **a. Add a Module into your Module List**   
`addm` adds a _module_ into your **Module List**. The **Module List** contains all your added _modules_ and can be viewed via the <b>[List Module command](#a-list-your-modules)</b>.  
  
##### **Format**   
`addm <module code>` 

- `module code` -- The _module code_ of the   _module_    
  
<div class="alert alert-warning">  
<i class="fa fa-exclamation"></i> <b>Note</b> <br>   
The <i>module code</i> is case-<b>insensitive</b>. However, it must correspond to a valid <b>NUS module</b>. Only <b>NUS modules</b> can be added in this version of <b>Nuke</b>.  
</div>  
  
##### **Example Usage**   
```  
addm cs2113t  
```  
  
##### **Expected Outcome**

<br>  
  
#### **b. Add a Category into your Category List**  
`addc` adds a _category_ into your **Category List**. The **Category List** contains all your added _categories_ in the _module_ and can be viewed via the <b>[List Category](#b-list-your-categories)</b> command.

### **2. List**   
Lists filtered <i>modules</i>, <i>categories</i>, <i>tasks</i> or <i>files</i>. <br>    
   
Similar to a Linux shell, <b>Nuke</b> has a generic command word for listing <i>child directories</i>: `ls` <br>  
In the table below, you can find what `ls` does at each level of the Directory.    
  
<div style="text-align: center"><span style="color: green"><small>Table <b>Generic List Command</b></small></span></div>   
  
| Current Level   | What Happens?                                                           |    
|:---------------:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|    
| <b>Root</b>     | `ls` shows all your <i>modules</i> in your <b>Module List</b><br>`ls <module code>` shows all the <i>categories</i> in the <b>Category List</b> of that <i>module</i>           |    
| <b>Module</b>   | `ls` shows all your <i>categories</i> in the <i>module</i>'s <b>Category List</b><br>`ls <category name>` shows all the <i>tasks</i> in the <b>Task List</b> of that <i>category</i> |

| <b>Task</b>     | `ls` shows all your <i>files</i> in the <i>task</i>'s <b>File List</b>  |    
| <b>File</b>     | You cannot `ls` here! &#128550;                                         |    
  
The above commands have to be done in their corresponding directories. On the other hand, the commands below can be done in any directory, but may require you to enter <i>additional</i> information.       
  
<div class="alert alert-info">  
<i class="fa fa-info"></i> <b>Info</b> <br>   
Both <b>List</b> commands <i>(with the exception of <b><a href="#d-list-your-tasks-sorted-by-deadline-or-priority">List your Tasks Sorted by Deadline or Priority</a></b> and <b><a href="#e-list-your-tasks-at-specified-time-period">List your Tasks at Specified Time Period</a></b>)</i> and <b><a href="#3-delete">Delete</a></b> commands function by first filtering the relevant items from the <i>keywords</i> that you provide. You can further choose to enter <code>-e</code> to filter using the <b><i>exact</i></b> <i>keyword</i>, and <code>-a</code> to filter across <b><i>all</i></b> the directories. <br>

#### **d. List your Tasks Sorted by Deadline or Priority**    
`lsts` shows your <b>undone</b> <i>tasks</i>. By default, the <i>tasks</i> will be sorted by <i>deadline</i>, from the earliest to the latest <i>deadline</i>.  You may also specify in the command to sort your <i>tasks</i> by <i>priority</i> instead, in descending order of <i>priority</i>, by including the `-p` prefix. <br>  
Also, you can further choose to view the sorted <i>tasks</i> of a specific <i>module</i>. By default, this command will show you the sorted list of <b>all</b> your <i>tasks</i>. You can enter the `module code` to view the sorted list of the <i>tasks</i> in that <i>module</i> instead.   
  
##### **Format**    
`lsts [ <module code> -d -p (choose at most one; default -d) ]`  

 `module code` -- The <i>module code</i> of the <i>module</i> for which its sorted list of <i>tasks</i> is to be shown  
   
<div class="alert alert-warning">  
<i class="fa fa-exclamation"></i> <b>Note</b> <br>   
Since the command sorts by <i>deadline</i> by default, you need <b>not</b> include the <code>-d</code> prefix if you want to sort your <i>tasks</i> by <i>deadline</i> &#128521;. <br>  
However, you must choose between sorting by <i>deadline</i> <i><u>or</u></i> by <i>priority</i>. Entering both <code>-d</code> <i><u>and</u></i> <code>-p</code> will cause an error message to be shown &#128552;.

### **3. Delete**   
Deletes <i>modules</i>, <i>categories</i>,  <i>tasks</i>, <i>files</i> or <i>tags</i> from their respective lists.     
You will be prompted to either enter `yes` to confirm the deletion <i>or</i> `no` to abort the deletion after entering the <b>Delete</b> command.     
<br>    
Like the [<b>Add</b>](#1-add) Command, **Nuke** also supports a generic command for deleting a directory: `rm` <br>     
The table below shows you `rm` does at each level of the Directory.   
  
<div style="text-align: center"><span style="color: green"><small>Table <b>Generic Delete Command</b></small></span></div>  
  
| Current Level   | What Happens?                                                        |    
|:---------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------|    
| <b>Root</b>     | `rm <module code>` deletes a *module* from the current directory     |    
| <b>Module</b>   | `rm <category name>` deletes a *category* from the current directory |    
| <b>Category</b> | `rm <task description>` deletes a *task* from the current directory  |    
| <b>Task</b>     | `rm <file name>` deletes a *file* from the current directory         |    
| <b>File</b>     | You cannot `rm` here! &#128556;                                      |    
    
The above commands have to be done in their corresponding directories. However, the commands below can be done in any directory, but may require you to enter <i>additional</i> information.      
  
<div class="alert alert-info">  
<i class="fa fa-info"></i> <b>Info</b> <br>   
Just like the <b><a href="#2-list">List</a></b> commands, the <b>Delete</b> command works by first filtering the relevant items from the <i>keywords</i> that you provide. You can further choose to enter <code>-e</code> to filter to the <b><i>exact</i></b> <i>keyword</i>, and <code>-a</code> to filter across <b><i>all</i></b> the directories. <br>    
For more information on how filtering is done, see <a href="#how-does-the-filtering-process-works">here</a>.  <br>  
<br>  
If there are <b>multiple</b> matches after filtering, you will receive a further prompt to let you choose which items you want to delete.  
</div>     
   
<div class="alert alert-warning">  
<i class="fa fa-exclamation"></i> <b>Note</b> <br>   
Please do <b>not</b> delete the <i>directory</i> you are in, <i>or</i> any of your current <i>directory</i>'s <i>parent directories</i>. Doing so will result in an error message to be shown &#128543;.

The **Nuke** program loads and saves your entire Directory List **automatically**, so there is no explicit way to freely load or save your file.      
   
#### **Loading**    
Loading is done once you start up the **Nuke** program. The data from the saved *directory list file* in your device is read to initialise your Directory List from when it was last saved.  
  
#### **Saving**   
Saving is done upon executing each of your commands in the **Nuke** program. Your Directory List will be saved into a *directory list file* in your device.

### **Date Time Formats**   
Any *date time* data that you provide has to adhere to certain formats pre-defined by the **Nuke** program. Failure to do so will likely result in the program to be unable to recognise your input command, and a warning will be shown &#128550;.      
Instances when you may need to enter a *date time* will be when adding a _deadline_ to your _tasks_, or when specifying the <i>date</i> in the <b>[Due](#e-list-your-tasks-at-specified-time-period)</b> command.  
      
Here are the following *date time* formats:    
      
#### **Date Formats**   
There are **two** types *date* formats allowed.    
  
##### **1. Words**    
You may enter **only** the following *date* words.    
- `today` or `tdy` -- represents the <u>current</u> date    
- `tomorrow` or `tmr` -- represents the <u>next</u> date    
- `yesterday` or `yst` -- represents the <u>previous</u> date    
- `monday` or `mon` -- represents the next <b>Monday</b> from the current date    
- `tuesday` or `tue` -- represents the next <b>Tuesday</b> from the current date    
- `wednesday` or `wed` -- represents the next <b>Wednesday</b> from the current date    
- `thursday` or `thu` -- represents the next <b>Thursday</b> from the current date    
- `friday` or `fri` -- represents the next <b>Friday</b> from the current date    
- `saturday` or `sat` -- represents the next <b>Saturday</b> from the current date    
- `sunday` or `sun` -- represents the next <b>Sunday</b> from the current date    
    
 <div class="alert alert-info">  
 <i class="fa fa-info"></i> <b>Info</b> <br>   
All dates are taken with reference to the current date on your device.  <br>    
  
If you specify the <i>date</i> using the day of the week <i>(i.e. <code>monday</code> ... <code>sunday</code>)</i>, and the current day is the day itself, the <i>date</i> will be referred to the current date. For example, if you enter <code>wednesday</code> and it is <b>Wednesday</b> today, the <i>date</i> will be the current date.  
</div>  
  
##### **2. Standard Date Format**     
This refers to the typical dates that are represented with **numbers** and **delimiter symbols**.      
   
In this **Nuke** program, *dates* should be in the order of **day**, **month**, then an <u>optional</u> **year**. If the **year** is not provided, the program will automatically assume it to be the **current year**.  Also, the **day**, **month** and **year** should only be entered as **numbers** and not words *(e.g. January is not accepted for the **month** attribute)*.    
      
Regarding **delimiters**, the program will **only** consider `/` and `-` as valid delimiters for *dates*.  Delimiters are <u>optional</u> and may be omitted provided you include the **year** of the *date* <i>(e.g. 1/1/20, 1/1 and 010120 are accepted, but not 0101</i> &#128559;<i>)</i>.    
  
An **exhaustive** list of the standard *date* formats is given below for your reference.    
```  
01/01/2020, 1/01/2020, 01/1/2020, 1/1/2020,  
01/01/20, 1/01/20, 01/1/20, 1/1/20,  
01/01, 1/01, 01/1, 1/1,  
01-01-2020, 1-01-2020, 01-1-2020, 1-1-2020,  
01-01-20, 1-01-20, 01-1-20, 1-1-20,   
01-01, 1-01, 01-1, 1-1,   
01012020, 010120  
```

<br>  
  
#### **Time Formats**    
The **Nuke** program accepts most time formats that are represented with **numbers**, **delimiter symbols** and <u>optional</u> **am-pm markers**.       
      
The *time* should be in the order of  **hour**, then **minute**. The **seconds** attribute of *time* should **not** be given. The **minute** attribute must be a **double** digit *(i.e. single digits must be padded with a 0 in front)*. The **minute** attribute is also <u>optional</u>, and should it be omitted, the **Nuke** program will automatically set the **minute** to be 0. Both the **12-h** format and the **24-h** format are valid *time* formats for this program.      
      
Regarding **delimiters**, the program will **only** consider `:` and `.` as valid delimiters for *time*.  Delimiters are <u>optional</u> and may be omitted.    
  
Lastly, the **am-pm marker** is an <u>optional</u> attribute, and should it be omitted, the **Nuke** program will automatically assume the *time* to follow the **24-h** format.    
  
An **exhaustive** list of the *time* formats is given below for your reference.    
```  
6:00pm, 18:00pm, 18:00, 
6.00am, 6.00am, 6.00,  
1130pm, 2330pm, 2330,  
3pm, 15pm, 15  
```  
  
[Back To Top](#table-of-contents)  
<br>  
  
#### **Time Specifier Formats**  
The <i>time specifier</i> is used in conjunction with a <i>date</i> to define the <i>time period</i> for the <b>[Due](#e-list-your-tasks-at-specified-time-period)</b> command. The following words are considered valid <i>time specifiers</i> in the <b>Nuke</b> program.     

- `on` -- <u>on</u> the specified  <i>date</i>    
- `after` or `a` -- <u>after</u> the specified  <i>date</i>    
- `before` or `b` -- <u>before</u> the specified  <i>date</i>  
  
The <i>time specifier</i> is <u>optional</u> and if omitted, is set to `on`.

## **FAQ**  
  
### **Can I not enter the Full Path?**  
<div>  
Yes, you <b>can</b>! &#128521; <br>   
You do <b>not</b> have to keep entering the <i>path</i> to the <i>directory</i> at the start of most of the commands in <b>Nuke</b>, in particular the <b><a href="#1-add">Add</a></b> and  <b><a href="#4-edit">Edit</a></b> commands.<br> In other words, you do <b>not</b> have to include the <code>-m  &lt;module code&gt;</code>,  <code>-c  &lt;category name&gt;</code>,  <code>-t  &lt;task description&gt;</code> and  <code>-f  &lt;file name&gt;</code>. <br><br>  
<b>Nuke</b> is able to intelligently fill in the missing components in the <i>path</i> for you. Here are various examples on how you can utilise this feature of <b>Nuke</b> to your advantage: <br><br>  
  
<b>In each of the examples below, we set the context to be at the Category level, and the <i>current path</i> to be <code>root / CS2113T / Project</code></b> <br><br>  
  
<b><u>Commands targeting Current Directory</u></b><br>  
If you want to add a <i>task</i> into the current <i>category</i> that you are in, that is into the <code>Project</code> <i>category</i>, instead of entering <code>addt new task -m cs2113t -c Project -p 4</code>, you can simply enter <code>addt new task -p 4</code>. &#128522; <br><br>  
  
<b><u>Commands targeting Parent Directory</u></b><br>  
If you want to edit a <i>file</i> that has the path <code>root / CS2113T / Project / tp / image_1</code>, instead of entering <code>edf image_1 -m cs2113t -c Project -t tp -f new file name</code> you can just enter <code>edf image_1 -t tp -f new file name</code>. &#128522; <br><br>  
  
<b><u>Commands targeting Child Directory</u></b><br>  
If you want to add a <i>category</i> to the <code>CS2113T</code> <i>module</i>, instead of entering <code>addc new category -m cs2113t -p 3</code>, you can enter <code>addc new category -p 3</code>.  &#128522; <br><br>  
  
<b><u>Commands targeting Nearby Directory</u></b><br>  
If you want to edit a <i>task</i>  that has the path <code>root / CS2113T / Lecture / read lecture notes</code>, instead of entering <code>edt read lecture notes -m cs2113t -c Lecture -p 3 -d sun 3pm</code> you can just enter <code>edt read lecture notes -c Lecture -p 3 -d sun 3pm</code>. &#128522; <br>  
<br>  
  
Essentially, <b>Nuke</b> will fill the missing components in the <i>path</i> based on your current <i>directory path</i>. Hence, it would be good to use the <b><a href="#5-change-directory">Change Directory</a></b> command to move to the corresponding <i>directory</i> first, so you do not have to enter the <i>full path</i>.  
</div>

<br>  
  
### **How does the Filtering Process works?**  
<div>  
<b>Nuke</b> does filtering for <b><a href="#2-list">List</a></b> and  <b><a href="#3-delete">Delete</a></b> commands. <b>Nuke</b> filters for the set of items that contains the <i>keywords</i> that you provide in the command. Filtering is always done in a case-<b>insensitive</b> manner. All <b>matched</b> items will be shown as a list. <br><br>  
  
Consider this example: <br>  
Let's assume you have three <i>tasks</i> with <i>directory paths</i><br>   
1. <code>root / CS2113T / Project / do UG</code>,<br>  
2. <code>root / CS2113T / Project / peer review</code> and<br>  
3. <code>root / CS2113T / group project / do ug faq section</code>.<br>  
  
Now, entering the command <code>lst -m cs -c project -t ug</code> should fetch only the first and third <i>tasks</i>.<br><br>  
  
Furthermore, if an attribute is left <b>empty</b>, such as <code>lst -m cs -t ug</code>, where the <code>-c &lt;category keyword&gt;</code> attribute is missing, <b>Nuke</b> will simply ignore filtering for <b>all</b> of the <i>categories</i>. In this case, <b>Nuke</b> will select all <i>tasks</i> with <i>module</i> containing <code>cs</code> in their <i>module code</i> and <i>tasks</i> containing <code>ug</code> in their <i>task description</i>. <br><br>  
  
Another feature of the filtering is that it tries to filter from the current <i>directory</i>. For example, if you are in the <i>path</i>  <code>root / CS2113T</code>, then entering <code>lsc</code> will fetch all of the <i>module</i> <code>CS2113T</code> 's <i>categories</i> only, instead of fetching all your <i>categories</i>. Unless you specify the corresponding <i>keyword</i>, or choose to filter <b>all</b> as explained later, <b>Nuke</b> will always behave in such a manner when filtering. <br> <br>  
  
In addition, there are <b>two</b> extra conditions you can include to the filtering process. They are: <br><br>  
  
<b><u>Filter Exactly</u></b><br>  
This can be activated by including a <code>-e</code> at the back of your command. This filters for items that <b>matches exactly</b> the <i>keyword</i>, instead of just containing the <i>keyword</i>. <br>  
For example, for <i>modules</i> with <i>paths</i>:<br>  
<code>root / CS2113</code> and <br>  
<code>root / CS2113T</code><br>  
when the command <code>delm cs2113 -e</code> is entered, only the first <i>module</i> is shown. <br>  
The  case-<b>insensitive</b> filtering and <b>empty</b> <i>keyword</i> property still holds even when filtering <b>exactly</b>. <br> <br>  
  
<b><u>Filter All</u></b><br>  
Similarly, this can be activated by including a <code>-a</code> at the back of your command. This filters for items in your entire <b>Directory List</b>, and not just limited to the current <i>directory</i>, which is the default setting. <br> <br>  
  
You can mix both <code>-e</code> and <code>-a</code> to filter exactly the way you want. &#128521;
